For example, if `n = 3`,  we should make a 6\" x 2\" grid with 1 row and 3 columns. If `n = 15`, we should make a 16\" x 4\" grid with 2 rows and 8 columns.

    "<small>**Note**: I'm intentionally glossing over the details of steps 1, 3, and 4 of the code. If you're curious about how the functions we imported such as `sample_images_of_category`, or `draw_images_on_subplots` work, you can check out their definitions [here](https://github.com/Kaggle/learntools/blob/master/learntools/python/quickdraw.py). The code uses lots of syntax and data structures that we'll cover later, so if it looks like gibberish to you at this point, don't worry. We will *not* be going into the specifics of data visualization using matplotlib or any other library in this course. But fortunately, we have a [course on Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualisation) on just that topic.</small>"
